## What is a decision record?

A **decision record** (DR) is a way to initiate, debate, and archive an important choice, along with its context and consequences.

A **decision log** (DL) is the collection of all DRs created and maintained for a particular project (or organization).

A **decision** in this context is an organization's choice that addresses a significant requirement.

A **significant requirement** (SR) is a project's need that has a measurable effect on a project's system.

All these terms are within the topic of **knowledge management** (KM).

The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of descion records.


## Decision record sections

  * **Title**: short present tense imperative up to 50 characters.

  * **Status**: request for comments | proposed | accepted | rejected | deprecated | superseded

  * **Issue**: describe the issue you want to address, and leave no questions about why.
  
  * **Assumptions**: describe any assumptions, premises, cross-project requirements, etc.
  
  * **Constraints**: capture any constraints to the environment this decision might pose. 

  * **Positions**: list the potential candidate options as facts and data, not opinions.

  * **Opinions**: by the team and stakeholders, and also third-party advisors and reviewers.

  * **Selection**: explain why you selected a position, with purspose and accountability.

  * **Implications**: state your decisionâ€™s implications, such as any need for changes.

  * **Related**: such as for references, cross-project work, and follow on needs.
  

## How to start using decision records

To start using decision records, talk with your teammates about these areas.

Decision identification:

  * How urgent and how important is the decision?

  * Does it have to be made now, or can it wait until more is known?

  * Both personal and collective experience, as well as recognized design methods and practices, can assist with decision identification.

  * Ideally maintain a decision todo list, that complements the product todo list.

Decision making:

  * A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software-specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping.

  * Group decision making is an active research topic.

Decision enactment and enforcement:

  * Decisions have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it.

  * Architecturally evident coding styles and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices.

  * Decisions can be reconsidered when making significant changes to a system, such as evolving a system, or upgrading a system, or adjusting a system for changing requirements.

Decision sharing (optional):

  * Many decisions recur across projects.

  * Hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy.

  * Group decision making is an active research topic.

Decision documentation:

  * Many templates and tools exisit for decisison planning and decision capturing.

  * See agile communities, e.g. M. Nygard's architectural decision records.

  * See traditional software engineering and architecture design processes, e.g. table layouts suggested by IBM UMF and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne.

Decision guidance:

  * The steps above are adopted from the Wikipedia entry on [Architectural Decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision)

  * A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping.
